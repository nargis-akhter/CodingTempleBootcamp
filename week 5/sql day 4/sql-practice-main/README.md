Querying data from a database is a very common skill in data science. Structured Query Language, abbreviated SQL, is one of the most common methods of pulling information from databases for further analysis.

In the context of the data science workflow, SQL is most commonly used when obtaining data, but can also be used for exploratory data analysis.
