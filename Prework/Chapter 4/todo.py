#tuple
. Buffet: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods Think of five
simple foods, and store them in a tuple
• Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers
• Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the
change
• The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different
foods Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for
loop to print each of the items on the revised menu
